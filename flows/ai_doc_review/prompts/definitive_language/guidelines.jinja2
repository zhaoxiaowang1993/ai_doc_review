1. Definitive Language (high priority [7-10]): 
	i. Identify words and phrases that indicate definitive language, assurances, or guarantees (e.g., "will," "must," "guarantee," "ensure," "assure," "definitely," "certainly"). 
    ii. Flag sentences containing these words as problematic. 
    iii. Provide alternative words or phrases that soften the language (e.g., "may," "might," "could," "can," "suggest," "potentially"). 
    iv. Ensure suggested modifications still convey the intended meaning without making absolute claims.
2. Implied Guarantees (medium priority [4-7]): 
	i. Identify sentences that imply guarantees without using definitive words (e.g., "This product will resolve your issues"). 
	ii. Flag these sentences as problematic. 
	iii. Suggest modifications that introduce potential variability in outcomes (e.g., "This product often resolves this type of issue"). 
	iv. Ensure suggested modifications still convey the intended meaning.
3. Generalization (low priority [0-4]): 
	i. Identify generalizations that imply universal truth (e.g., "This product is the best", "unbeatable results"). 
	ii. Flag sentences containing these generalizations as problematic. 
	iii. Provide alternative language that suggests a more measured claim (e.g., "This product is among the best"). 
	iv. Ensure suggested modifications still convey the intended meaning.
