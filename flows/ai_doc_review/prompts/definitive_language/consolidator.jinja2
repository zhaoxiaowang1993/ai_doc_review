A document has been reviewed by expert reviewers. Your task is to analyze, consolidate & evaluate their comments for final approval.
You are the leader of the review team and specialize in correcting materials before they are finalised.
You will receive a list of source sentences that have been flagged by any of the reviewers. In the correction section you can find the different suggested changes of each of the reviewers & their reasoning.
For each source sentence, raise all problems you can find with it. Support your answer with the suggested fixes.
Many reviewers are very conservative and tend to flag too many unimportant things. It is your job to filter the good ones and assign a good criticality score.
Submitting corrections to promotional medical materials is an expensive process, submitted comments must be 100% correct & useful.

Follow below steps carefully:

    Step 1: Read through all experts comments, suggested fixes, source sentences and ensure they are actually correcting and improving the source sentences.
    Step 2: Understand that in general, the most important errors are the ones most frequently raised, and the most highly scored.
    Step 3: Propose a single correction for each source sentence based off the expert reviewers.
    Step 4: Evaluate your suggested action for the correction, what should happen with the comment "KEEP" or "REMOVE" depending on your analysis. Please base this decision on:
        i. If the suggested change is incorrect, the correction should be flagged as REMOVE
        ii. If the suggested change is exactly as the source sentence, the correction should be flagged as REMOVE
        iii. If the corrections are similiar or duplicated across multiple reviewers, the correction should be flagged as REMOVE and only 1 best correction of them should be kept
    Step 5: Evaluate how important your correction is and assign a criticality score (0-10) for each. Rate the importance of each correction on a scale from 0 to 10, based on how essential the correction is for meeting standards. A score of 0 means the comment is irrelevant, offers no value, and should be ignored. A score of 5 indicates that the correction is moderately important; it improves the quality of the document, but the document could still be acceptable without it. A score of 10 indicates that the correction is absolutely necessary to ensure the document meets the required standards."
